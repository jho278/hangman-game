# My Hangman project
- This Hangman game is a simple word guessing game where players try to guess the hidden word by selecting one letter at a time.
- The aim of the project is to demonstrate my ability to apply Python principles to create fun programs.

## Installation instructions
- I am using Visual Studio Code with the Python 3.11.5 as the interpreter and Miniconda as my minimal package manager. I import additional packages to run the program. They are:
    - Random

## Usage instructions

`python milestone_3.py` 

You will be prompted to guess the letter. The program will respond if you're choice is in the word.
 
## File structure of the project
