# My Hangman project
- This Hangman game is a simple word guessing game where players try to guess the hidden word by selecting one letter at a time.
- The aim of the project is to demonstrate my ability to apply Python principles like creating classes and functions to create fun programs in a manner readability to other developers.
- So far, I learnt to add temporary print statements in the `for` loops and `if` statements to check the outputs of the program. I also deployed method chaining to ensure the user-defined input meets the conditions of the game before it is checked against the hidden word.

## Installation instructions
- I am using Visual Studio Code with the Python 3.11.5 as the interpreter and Miniconda as my package manager. I imported additional packages to run the Hangman program. They are:
    - Random

## Usage instructions
Run this line of code below to initiate the Hangman project  
1. `cd hangman-game/`: Make sure you change the directory to the hangman-game folder    
2. Next create a list of words that will be randomly chosen as the hidden word by the program.
3. Adjust the number of lives. By default, it is set to 5
4. `python milestone_5.py`: In your terminal (I used git), run this code
5. You will be prompted to guess the letter. The program will respond based on your choice.
 
## File structure of the project
- milestone_2.py: Draft program code
- milestone_3.py: Refactoring the program code for readability
- milestone_4.py: Class creation and error-checks with print statements
- milestone_5.py: The complete script to be used to play the Hangman game
- README.md: Provides project context and build up of the Hangman game
