# My Hangman project
- This Hangman game is a simple word guessing game where players try to guess the hidden word by selecting one letter at a time.
- The aim of the project is to demonstrate my ability to apply Python principles like creating classes and functions to create fun programs in a manner readability to other developers.
- So far, I have learnt to add temporary print statements in for loops and if statements to check the outputs of the program.

## Installation instructions
- I am using Visual Studio Code with the Python 3.11.5 as the interpreter and Miniconda as my minimal package manager. I import additional packages to run the program. They are:
    - Random

## Usage instructions
Run this line of code below to initiate the Hangman project  

`cd hangman-game`: Make sure you change the directory to the hangman-game folder  
`python milestone_4.py`: In your terminal (using gitbas here), run the following code

You will be prompted to guess the letter. The program will respond based on your choice.
 
## File structure of the project
- milestone_2.py: Draft program code
- milestone_3.py: Refactoring the program code for readability
- milestone_4.py: Class creation and error-checks with print statements
- README.md: Provides project context
